# RESTful Web API on an ASP.NET Core platform using Swagger

This application is a web service that can interact with various applications. At the same time, the application can be an `ASP.NET` web application, or it can be a mobile or regular desktop application.
***
#### What is `Swagger`?

`Swaggerâ„¢` is a project used to describe and document `RESTful APIs`.

The `Swagger` specification defines a set of files required to describe such an API. These files can then be used by the `Swagger-UI` project to display the `API` and `Swagger-Codegen` to generate clients in various languages. Additional utilities can also take advantage of the resulting files, such as testing tools.
